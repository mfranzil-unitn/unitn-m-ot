\section{Executive summary}
\label{sec:executive-sumamry}

Modern network systems are nowadays increasingly subject to attacks. As their techniques evolve and become more complex, so must the defenses of the targeted systems. In the two CCTFs, we used our technical, coding, and team skills to simultaneously coordinate a network attack and protect from it in a realistic scenario. 

As a red team, we leveraged our coding and research capabilities to build a vast arsenal of tools. These included both self-written and open-source software. With such weapons, we planned our attacks, dividing the work between members. We developed a strategy encompassing the first stages of penetration testing from pre-engagement to exploitation. In the live CCTFs, we were able to effectively stress the capabilities of the defending team, sometimes even succeeding with our efforts.

As a blue team, we focused on building a system that could withstand enemy attacks while providing a crystal-clear overview of its state, promptly informing us if an attack were to occur. We did extensive research on the features offered by the Linux environment, modifying the TCP/IP stack configuration and developing robust and specific firewall rules. We employed state-of-the-art tools such as Varnish and Nginx, and we wrote custom tools for displaying real-time information on traffic, requests, and system load.

%Key takeaways of your defense and attack technologies and overall outcome of the two CCTFs from your perspective. (To write at the end, 250 words)
