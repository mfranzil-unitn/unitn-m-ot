For locating the images, I used the following command:

sudo find / -iname "*intro*" > out.txt

The out.txt was then grep-ped in order to locate the five jpeg files.

The diskfree.txt file was obtained by piping out the output of the df -H command. 

The CPU info was obtained with cat /proc/cpuinfo.
